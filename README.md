I am a Frontend developer with experience in **Vue.js** and **React.js**, backend knowledge in **Node.js**, and **Express**, database knowledge in **PostgreSQL** and **MongoDB**, experience with **Typescript**, to maximize coding level and consistency and Git and Github to keep everything versioned. I also have a Bachelor's degree in **Business Administration**, which helps me a lot to have business insights.

:heavy_check_mark: A little list about myself:

* :books: Learning lover - I am a big fan of learning new things and get better on them;
* :earth_americas: Teamworker - If I can do good things alone, I can do much better things along with a good team;
* :muscle: Resilient and open-minded - The world changes fast and so we need too;
* :neckbeard: A little bit nerd - My nickname **gughog**? Is from my D&D character, haha!;
* :cat: Pet lover - I am with the animal cause and do my best to make my fur friends live with dignity;
* :meat_on_bone: Great Cooking Chef wannabe - I'm not so great but I love to cook and I try to do my best at this;

I also love to read and write (currently I write on my blog (You can read here: [**gughog.github.io**](https://gughog.github.io/)) where I try to bring technical programming posts to beginners and to pro developers too), feel free to read!
